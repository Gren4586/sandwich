                <h2 class="about-paragraph header">Who are we?</h2>
                <p class="about-paragraph paragraph">The Sandwich Society was formed twenty years ago when one man, Jared Sandwich, made too many sandwiches one day. He began parading the streets offering his extras to anyone who wanted them, and this began a weekly tradition of the town's men gathering once a week to bond over one man's leftovers. Though our beloved founder has since passed away due to medical complications brought on by hard drug usage, his spirit lives on in the Sandwich Society.</p>
